## 1. Abstract

Rare diseases collectively affect 300-400 million people worldwide, yet the average patient endures a 5-7 year "diagnostic odyssey" before receiving a definitive diagnosis. This delay stems from fragmented clinical knowledge, incomplete phenotype-genotype databases, and the inherent difficulty of recognizing conditions that most clinicians encounter rarely or never.

We present the Rare Disease Diagnostic Agent, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system built on NVIDIA DGX Spark that integrates structured phenotype matching via the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), ACMG/AMP variant classification, disease-gene association databases, and gene therapy eligibility assessment into a unified diagnostic support platform. The system employs 14 domain-specific vector collections, 10 diagnostic workflows, and 6 calibrated decision support engines to deliver evidence-based differential diagnoses, variant interpretations, and therapeutic recommendations in real time.

Deployed as part of the HCLS AI Factory precision medicine platform, the agent demonstrates that RAG-based diagnostic intelligence can meaningfully compress the diagnostic timeline for rare disease patients while maintaining the evidence rigor required for clinical decision support.

## 2. The Diagnostic Odyssey Problem

### 2.1 Definition

The "diagnostic odyssey" describes the prolonged, often emotionally devastating journey that rare disease patients and families experience between symptom onset and definitive diagnosis. During this period, patients typically:

- See 7-8 specialists across multiple institutions
- Receive 2-3 misdiagnoses before the correct one
- Undergo numerous unnecessary tests and procedures
- Experience delayed access to disease-modifying therapies
- Suffer psychological burden from diagnostic uncertainty

### 2.2 Root Causes

**Knowledge fragmentation:** With over 7,000 known rare diseases and new conditions described annually, no single clinician can maintain comprehensive knowledge across all rare diseases. Clinical genetics training covers a fraction of known conditions, and most general practitioners encounter specific rare diseases only once or twice in their careers.

**Phenotypic heterogeneity:** The same genetic variant can produce markedly different clinical presentations (variable expressivity and reduced penetrance). Conversely, similar phenotypes can result from variants in different genes (genetic heterogeneity). This many-to-many relationship between genotypes and phenotypes makes pattern recognition exceptionally difficult.

**Temporal evolution:** Disease manifestations change over time. Early presentations may be non-specific, and characteristic features may not appear until later childhood or adulthood. A patient evaluated at age 2 may present very differently from the same disease at age 12.

**Geographic and demographic disparities:** Access to genetic testing, clinical genetics expertise, and rare disease centers varies enormously by region, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity. Patients in rural areas or low-resource settings face even longer diagnostic delays.

### 2.3 Clinical Impact

Diagnostic delay has measurable clinical consequences:
- Missed treatment windows for time-sensitive therapies (e.g., gene therapy for SMA)
- Progressive organ damage from treatable conditions (e.g., untreated PKU causing intellectual disability)
- Unnecessary invasive procedures driven by incorrect diagnoses
- Reproductive implications: families unable to make informed decisions about future pregnancies

## 4. Limitations of Current Diagnostic Approaches

### 4.1 Traditional Clinical Diagnosis

Traditional rare disease diagnosis relies on the "clinical gestalt" -- a clinician's ability to recognize phenotype patterns. While expert clinicians achieve high accuracy for diseases within their specialty, this approach fails for conditions outside their experience, novel gene-disease associations, and multi-system disorders that span specialties.

### 4.2 Genetic Testing Without Decision Support

Whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) have transformed rare disease diagnosis, achieving diagnostic yields of 25-50%. However, these technologies generate thousands of genetic variants per patient, and clinical interpretation remains the bottleneck. Variants of uncertain significance (VUS) constitute the majority of findings, and their classification requires integration of population frequency data, functional studies, computational predictions, and phenotype correlation -- information scattered across multiple databases with different formats and access methods.

### 4.3 Existing Decision Support Tools

Current tools address fragments of the diagnostic workflow:
- **Phenotype-matching tools** (e.g., PhenomeCentral, AMELIE) excel at HPO-based disease ranking but do not integrate variant interpretation
- **Variant classifiers** (e.g., InterVar, Franklin) focus on ACMG classification but lack phenotype context
- **Gene therapy databases** exist in isolation from diagnostic workflows
- **None** provide end-to-end workflow support from phenotype intake through diagnosis to therapy matching

## 5. The RAG-Based Solution

### 5.1 Why RAG for Rare Disease

Retrieval-Augmented Generation addresses the rare disease diagnostic challenge by combining the broad knowledge of large language models with precise retrieval from structured clinical databases. This approach offers several advantages:

1. **Dynamic knowledge:** Unlike fine-tuned models, RAG systems can be updated by adding new records to vector collections without retraining
2. **Evidence traceability:** Every diagnostic recommendation is grounded in retrievable evidence with source citations
3. **Multi-source fusion:** RAG naturally combines information from phenotype databases (HPO), variant databases (ClinVar), disease registries (OMIM/Orphanet), and clinical literature
4. **Graceful knowledge limits:** The system can acknowledge uncertainty rather than generating plausible-sounding but unsupported conclusions

### 5.2 Architecture Summary

The Rare Disease Diagnostic Agent implements a multi-collection RAG architecture:

- **14 vector collections** organized by information type (phenotypes, diseases, genes, variants, literature, trials, therapies, case reports, guidelines, pathways, registries, natural history, newborn screening, genomic evidence)
- **384-dimensional embeddings** via BGE-small-en-v1.5 for efficient similarity search
- **Workflow-specific search weights** that dynamically prioritize collections based on the diagnostic question
- **Decision support engines** that provide structured clinical reasoning alongside RAG retrieval

### 5.3 Design Principles

1. **Evidence-first:** Every output includes evidence sources and confidence levels
2. **Workflow-driven:** Clinical questions map to structured diagnostic workflows with domain-appropriate collection weighting
3. **Graceful degradation:** System operates meaningfully even without LLM access or Milvus connectivity
4. **Standards-based:** HPO for phenotypes, ACMG/AMP for variants, OMIM/Orphanet for diseases

---

## 6. HPO Ontology Integration

### 6.1 The Human Phenotype Ontology

The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides a standardized vocabulary of ~18,000 terms for describing human phenotypic abnormalities. Each term has a unique identifier (e.g., HP:0001250 for "Seizure"), definition, synonyms, and hierarchical relationships.

### 6.2 Information Content Scoring

The system uses Information Content (IC) scoring to weight HPO terms by their discriminating power:

```
IC(t) = -log2(p(t))
```

where p(t) is the frequency of term t across annotated disease entries.

Highly specific terms (low frequency) receive high IC scores, making them more informative for diagnosis. For example:
- HP:0002816 (Genu recurvatum): IC = 7.64 -- highly specific
- HP:0001250 (Seizures): IC = 2.74 -- common, less discriminating

### 6.3 Best-Match-Average Similarity

Patient-to-disease phenotype matching uses the Best-Match-Average (BMA) algorithm:

```
BMA(P, D) = 0.5 * (avg max-IC P->D + avg max-IC D->P)
```

This bidirectional matching rewards phenotype overlap while penalizing both missing patient features (expected disease features not observed) and extra patient features (observed features not typical of the disease). The combined score incorporates phenotype frequency weighting from gene-disease association databases.

## 7. ACMG/AMP Variant Classification

### 7.1 The ACMG/AMP Framework

The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) published consensus guidelines in 2015 for classifying genetic variants into five tiers: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, variant of uncertain significance (VUS), likely benign, and benign.

### 7.2 Implementation

The agent implements 23 of the 28 ACMG criteria with numerical scoring:

**Pathogenic evidence** (16 criteria): PVS1 (null variant in LOF-intolerant gene, +8 points), PS1-PS4 (strong evidence, +3-4 points each), PM1-PM6 (moderate evidence, +1-2 points each), PP1-PP5 (supporting evidence, +1 point each).

**Benign evidence** (8 criteria): BA1 (standalone benign, frequency > 5%), BS1-BS2 (strong benign evidence), BP1-BP7 (supporting benign evidence).

**Classification thresholds:** Pathogenic >= 10 points, Likely Pathogenic >= 6, VUS = 1-5, Likely Benign >= 4 (benign score), Benign >= 6 (benign score) or BA1 alone.

### 7.3 LOF-Intolerant Gene Database

The PVS1 criterion applies only to loss-of-function variants in genes where haploinsufficiency is a known disease mechanism. The system maintains a curated list of 20 LOF-intolerant genes based on gnomAD constraint scores (pLI > 0.9), including SCN1A, MECP2, KCNQ1, FBN1, and others.

## 8. Phenotype-Driven Differential Diagnosis

### 8.1 Approach

Given a set of patient HPO terms, the system generates a ranked differential diagnosis by:

1. Computing BMA similarity between patient terms and disease-associated phenotypes for each candidate disease
2. Applying IC-weighted scoring to prioritize matches on specific (high-IC) rather than common (low-IC) phenotypes
3. Incorporating inheritance pattern consistency with family history
4. Cross-referencing with population prevalence data
5. Reporting matched and unmatched phenotypes for each candidate to support clinical review

### 8.2 Output Structure

Each disease candidate includes:
- Rank and similarity score (0.0-1.0)
- Matched HPO terms (patient phenotypes present in the disease)
- Unmatched HPO terms (disease phenotypes not observed in the patient)
- Inheritance pattern and prevalence
- Causal genes and OMIM/Orphanet identifiers
- Disease category classification

## 9. Gene Therapy Matching

### 9.1 The Gene Therapy Revolution

The rare disease field is experiencing a gene therapy revolution. Since 2017, 12 gene therapies have received FDA or EMA approval for rare diseases, with dozens more in clinical trials. These therapies use viral vectors (AAV, lentivirus) or gene editing (CRISPR) to address the root genetic cause of disease.

### 9.2 Eligibility Complexity

Gene therapy eligibility is highly specific:
- **Genotype-specific:** Trikafta (CFTR modulator) requires at least one F508del allele
- **Age-restricted:** Many gene therapies have age cutoffs
- **Mutation-type-dependent:** Some therapies work only for specific mutation classes
- **Pre-existing immunity:** AAV-based therapies may be contraindicated in patients with pre-existing anti-AAV antibodies

### 9.3 Agent Capability

The agent matches patients to gene therapies through:
1. Disease-specific matching (12 approved therapies cataloged)
2. Genotype-specific eligibility assessment
3. Clinical trial matching for investigational therapies
4. Access pathway information (compassionate use, expanded access)

## 10. System Architecture

### 10.1 Three-Engine Platform Context

The Rare Disease Diagnostic Agent operates within the HCLS AI Factory, a three-engine precision medicine platform on NVIDIA DGX Spark:

1. **Genomics Engine:** Parabricks/DeepVariant/BWA-MEM2 for FASTQ-to-VCF variant calling (GPU-accelerated)
2. **RAG/Chat Engine:** Milvus (3.56M vectors) + Claude AI for variant interpretation and evidence synthesis
3. **Drug Discovery Engine:** BioNeMo MolMIM/DiffDock/RDKit for therapeutic lead generation

The agent connects to all three engines: consuming VCF output from Engine 1, sharing the genomic_evidence collection with Engine 2, and receiving drug candidate data from Engine 3 for gene therapy matching.

### 10.2 Agent Architecture

The system follows a three-tier architecture:

- **Presentation:** 5-tab Streamlit UI (port 8544) with NVIDIA dark theme
- **Application:** FastAPI REST API (port 8134) with 20 endpoints, CORS, authentication
- **Data:** Milvus vector store (port 19530) with 14 domain-specific collections

The application tier contains 10 diagnostic workflows, 6 decision support engines, a multi-collection RAG engine, and a query expansion system with 120+ entity aliases. All components operate independently of Milvus connectivity, ensuring the system remains functional for clinical decision support even in degraded environments.

### 10.3 Cross-Agent Coordination

The agent integrates with 4 peer agents for comprehensive rare disease evaluation:

- **Cardiology Agent (:8126):** Cardiac genetics referral for channelopathies (KCNQ1, SCN5A) and cardiomyopathy (MYH7, MYBPC3)
- **Biomarker Agent (:8529):** Biomarker stratification for rare disease subtyping and treatment monitoring
- **PGx Agent (:8107):** Pharmacogenomic screening before orphan drug initiation or gene therapy preparation
- **Imaging Agent (:8524):** Imaging correlation for neurogenetic diagnoses (brain MRI), skeletal dysplasias (skeletal survey), and connective tissue disorders (echocardiography)

### 10.4 Pediatric Oncology Applications

The agent addresses pediatric rare disease at the intersection of oncology and genetics:

- **Hereditary Cancer Predisposition Syndromes:** Li-Fraumeni (TP53) presenting with childhood sarcomas and adrenocortical carcinoma; retinoblastoma (RB1) with germline testing for bilateral disease in infants; VHL syndrome with pediatric-onset pheochromocytoma
- **Inborn Errors of Metabolism:** Urgent neonatal metabolic workup for conditions detected by newborn screening (PKU, MSUD, galactosemia, biotinidase deficiency), with treatment initiation timelines measured in hours to days
- **Neonatal Screening Integration:** NBS-to-diagnosis pipeline connecting the rd_newborn_screening collection (80 conditions) with confirmatory testing algorithms and immediate treatment protocols

## 16. Discussion

### 16.1 Advantages

The RAG-based approach offers several advantages over traditional diagnostic support tools:

1. **Unified platform:** Integrates phenotype matching, variant classification, and therapy identification in a single workflow
2. **Evidence traceability:** All recommendations are grounded in retrievable evidence
3. **Extensibility:** New diseases, genes, and therapies can be added without retraining
4. **Standards compliance:** HPO, ACMG/AMP, OMIM, and Orphanet standards ensure interoperability

### 16.2 Limitations

The current implementation has limitations that should be acknowledged:
- Knowledge base uses curated seed data rather than full database dumps
- ACMG classification is simplified (production systems require additional SVI-level refinement)
- Natural history data covers 6 diseases (expanding to 100+ planned)
- No HIPAA compliance validation (required for clinical deployment)
- Single-node deployment without horizontal scaling

## 17. Future Directions

1. **Full HPO integration:** Ingest complete HPO ontology (~18,000 terms) with hierarchical traversal
2. **ClinVar full dump:** Integrate complete ClinVar variant database (500,000+ variants)
3. **Phenotype NLP:** Extract HPO terms from free-text clinical notes using NLP
4. **Multi-omics integration:** Incorporate metabolomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics data
5. **Family pedigree visualization:** Interactive pedigree drawing and segregation analysis
6. **International NBS integration:** Support for jurisdiction-specific NBS panels
7. **Real-time ClinVar updates:** Automated variant re-classification on database updates
8. **HIPAA compliance:** PHI handling, audit logging, and access controls for clinical use

---

## 18. Conclusion

The Rare Disease Diagnostic Agent demonstrates that RAG-based AI systems can meaningfully address the diagnostic odyssey by providing clinicians with integrated, evidence-based decision support that spans the full diagnostic workflow -- from phenotype intake through variant classification to gene therapy matching. By combining structured ontology-based matching (HPO/ACMG) with the contextual reasoning capabilities of large language models, the system offers a path toward faster, more accurate rare disease diagnosis while maintaining the evidence rigor that clinical decision-making demands.
