## 1. Executive Summary

The Rare Disease Diagnostic Agent is a production-grade, RAG-powered decision support system for rare disease diagnosis, variant interpretation, and therapeutic matching, built for the HCLS AI Factory precision medicine platform running on NVIDIA DGX Spark. It addresses the "diagnostic odyssey" -- the average 5-7 year journey families endure before receiving a rare disease diagnosis -- by combining 14 domain-specific Milvus vector collections, six calibrated decision support engines, 10 diagnostic workflows, and an autonomous reasoning pipeline that plans, searches, evaluates, and synthesizes diagnostic evidence in real time.

The agent is architected as a three-tier system: a 5-tab Streamlit UI (port 8544) for interactive rare disease diagnostic exploration, a FastAPI REST API (port 8134) exposing 20 endpoints for programmatic integration, and a RAG engine backed by Milvus (port 19530) with BGE-small-en-v1.5 384-dimensional embeddings. All 10 diagnostic workflows, all 6 decision support engines, and the full query expansion system operate independently of Milvus connectivity, ensuring graceful degradation and robust demo capability even when the vector store is unavailable.

The codebase comprises 40 Python files (27 source + 13 test) totaling 22,378 lines of code (20,640 source + 1,738 test), with 206 passing tests at a 100% pass rate (~1.5 min execution time). The knowledge base encompasses 13 disease categories covering 28 metabolic diseases, 23 neurological diseases, 15 hematologic diseases, 13 immunologic diseases, 10 connective tissue disorders, 8 cancer predisposition syndromes, 12 approved gene therapies, 23 of 28 ACMG variant classification criteria, 23 HPO top-level terms, and 9 diagnostic algorithms. This report documents every capability, data dimension, and test result to serve as the definitive long-term reference for the Rare Disease Diagnostic Agent.

### 4.2 Workflow Architecture

All workflows inherit from `BaseRareDiseaseWorkflow` and follow the template-method pattern:

```
preprocess(inputs) -> execute(processed_inputs) -> postprocess(result) -> WorkflowResult
```

Each workflow produces a `WorkflowResult` containing:
- `findings`: Key diagnostic findings (list of strings)
- `recommendations`: Recommended next steps
- `guideline_references`: Clinical guideline citations
- `severity`: SeverityLevel (CRITICAL/HIGH/MODERATE/LOW/INFORMATIONAL)
- `cross_agent_triggers`: Other agents to consult
- `confidence`: Workflow confidence score (0.0-1.0)
- `diagnostic_result`: Optional full DiagnosticResult

### 4.3 Workflow-Specific Collection Weights

Each workflow dynamically adjusts search weights across all 14 collections to prioritize domain-relevant evidence. Example weight distributions:

**Phenotype-Driven Diagnosis:**
- rd_phenotypes: 0.22 (highest), rd_diseases: 0.18, rd_case_reports: 0.12, rd_genes: 0.10

**Gene Therapy Eligibility:**
- rd_therapies: 0.22 (highest), rd_trials: 0.15, rd_genes: 0.12, rd_variants: 0.10

**Inborn Errors of Metabolism:**
- rd_pathways: 0.20 (highest), rd_diseases: 0.14, rd_genes: 0.12, rd_newborn_screening: 0.10

## 5. Decision Support Engines

### 5.1 Engine Inventory (6 Engines)

| # | Engine | Class | Purpose | Key Algorithm |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | HPO-to-Gene Matcher | `HPOToGeneMatcher` | Match patient phenotypes to candidate genes | Best-Match-Average (BMA) similarity with IC scoring |
| 2 | ACMG Variant Classifier | `ACMGVariantClassifier` | Classify variants per ACMG/AMP guidelines | 28-criteria scoring (PVS1 through BP7) |
| 3 | Orphan Drug Matcher | `OrphanDrugMatcher` | Match disease/genotype to orphan therapies | Exact disease, pathway, and repurposing matching |
| 4 | Diagnostic Algorithm Recommender | `DiagnosticAlgorithmRecommender` | Recommend ordered test sequences | 6 phenotype cluster pathways |
| 5 | Family Segregation Analyzer | `FamilySegregationAnalyzer` | Analyze variant segregation in pedigrees | Simplified LOD score calculation |
| 6 | Natural History Predictor | `NaturalHistoryPredictor` | Predict disease milestones with confidence intervals | Registry-derived milestone prediction |

### 5.2 HPO-to-Gene Matcher -- Detail

The HPO-to-Gene Matcher uses Information Content (IC) scoring combined with Best-Match-Average (BMA) semantic similarity to rank candidate genes for a patient's phenotype profile.

**Information Content:** `IC(t) = -log2(p(t))` where `p(t)` is the frequency of HPO term `t` across annotated diseases. Rare phenotypes (low frequency) have high IC, providing stronger discriminating power.

**BMA Similarity:** `BMA(P, G) = 0.5 * (avg max-IC P->G + avg max-IC G->P)`, providing bidirectional matching that penalizes both missing and extra phenotypes.

**Combined Score:** `combined = BMA * 0.7 + freq_weight * 0.3`, incorporating phenotype frequency within specific gene-disease associations.

Currently maps 40+ HPO terms across 14 genes (CFTR, FBN1, SCN1A, DMD, HTT, KCNQ1, MYH7, SMN1, MECP2, PAH, GBA1, COL5A1, OTC, FGFR3).

### 5.3 ACMG Variant Classifier -- Detail

Implements simplified but complete ACMG/AMP scoring logic:
- 16 pathogenic criteria (PVS1 through PP5) with weighted scoring
- 8 benign criteria (BA1 through BP7) with weighted scoring
- 20 LOF-intolerant genes (pLI > 0.9) for PVS1 assessment
- Mutational hot spot database for PM1 (FGFR3, BRAF, KRAS, TP53)

### 5.4 Orphan Drug Matcher -- Detail

Catalogs 12+ orphan drugs with three match types:
1. **Exact disease match:** Direct indication (e.g., Trikafta for CF)
2. **Pathway match:** Same gene/pathway, different disease
3. **Repurposing candidates:** Mechanism-based matching

Includes genotype-specific matching (e.g., "F508del homozygous" for Orkambi eligibility).

### 5.5 Family Segregation Analyzer -- Detail

Computes simplified LOD scores for variant segregation:
- Each concordant meiosis: +0.3
- Each discordant meiosis: -1.0
- ACMG evidence levels: PS (LOD >= 3.0), PM (>= 1.5), PP (>= 0.6)
- Supports AD, AR, XL-dominant, XL-recessive inheritance

### 5.6 Natural History Predictor -- Detail

Curated milestone data for 6 diseases (SMA-1, DMD, CF, PKU, Marfan, Dravet) with:
- Median age and range for each milestone
- Confidence intervals (0.50-0.95)
- Genotype-modifier effects (e.g., "smn2_copies_3" -> milder course)
- Future milestone filtering by patient current age

1. **Query Analysis:** Detect workflow type, extract HPO terms, identify entities
2. **Query Expansion:** Resolve aliases, expand synonyms, add related terms
3. **Embedding:** BGE-small-en-v1.5 encoding (384-dim)
4. **Multi-Collection Search:** Parallel COSINE similarity search across relevant collections
5. **Result Fusion:** Weighted merge using workflow-specific collection weights
6. **Context Assembly:** Rank and filter top-K results, build evidence context
7. **LLM Synthesis:** Claude generates diagnostic assessment with citations

### 8.2 Search Pipeline

```
Query -> Expansion -> Embedding -> [14 Collections] -> Weighted Merge -> Top-K -> LLM
```

### 8.3 Configuration

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Score Threshold | 0.4 |
| Top-K Phenotypes | 50 |
| Top-K Diseases | 30 |
| Top-K Genes | 30 |
| Top-K Variants | 100 |
| Top-K Literature | 20 |
| Max Conversation Context | 3 turns |
| Citation High Threshold | 0.75 |
| Citation Medium Threshold | 0.60 |

## 9. Query Expansion System

### 9.1 Entity Aliases (120+)

Maps abbreviations and alternative names to canonical disease/gene terms:
- Metabolic disease abbreviations: PKU, MSUD, MCAD, OTC, MMA, PA, MPS I-VII, NPC, GSD, CDG, VLCAD, IEM, LSD
- Neurological abbreviations: SMA, DMD, BMD, CMT, TSC, NF1, NF2, HD, FRDA, AT
- Immunologic: SCID, CGD, CVID, WAS, XLA
- Connective tissue: EDS, OI, LDS
- Cardiac: HCM, DCM, LQTS, ARVC, BrS

### 9.2 HPO Synonym Mapping

Expands clinical descriptions to HPO term IDs:
- "seizures" -> HP:0001250, "fits" -> HP:0001250
- "floppy baby" -> HP:0001252 (Hypotonia)
- "short stature" -> HP:0004322
- "big head" -> HP:0000256 (Macrocephaly)

### 9.3 Workflow-Aware Boosting

Query terms are boosted based on detected workflow context:
- Metabolic workflow: boost pathway, enzyme, metabolite terms
- Cardiac workflow: boost channelopathy, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia terms
- Gene therapy workflow: boost therapy, eligibility, vector terms

---

## 10. Autonomous Agent Pipeline

### 10.1 Agent Architecture

The autonomous agent pipeline follows a plan-search-evaluate-synthesize loop:

1. **Plan:** Analyze query, detect workflow, generate search plan
2. **Search:** Execute multi-collection searches with workflow-specific weights
3. **Evaluate:** Score and rank results, apply decision support engines
4. **Synthesize:** Generate structured diagnostic report with evidence citations

### 10.2 Search Plan Generation

Each query generates a `SearchPlan` containing:
- `workflow_type`: Detected or specified diagnostic workflow
- `collections`: Ordered list of collections to search
- `weights`: Per-collection relevance weights
- `top_k_per_collection`: Result count per collection
- `hpo_terms`: Extracted HPO term IDs
- `filters`: Metadata filters (disease category, gene, etc.)
- `urgency`: Clinical urgency level (routine/priority/emergent)

## 25. Codebase Summary

### 25.1 File Inventory

| Directory | Files | LOC | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| src/ | 15 | ~14,500 | Core source (agent, workflows, decision support, knowledge, models, RAG, query expansion, metrics, scheduler, export, collections, cross-modal, ingest/) |
| tests/ | 13 | 1,738 | Test suite (206 tests, 100% pass) |
| api/ | 5 | ~2,300 | FastAPI REST API (main, routes/diagnostic_clinical, routes/reports, routes/events) |
| app/ | 2 | ~800 | Streamlit UI (diagnostic_ui) |
| config/ | 1 | ~200 | Pydantic settings |
| scripts/ | 4 | ~1,074 | Setup, seed, ingest, DOCX generation |
| docs/ | 10 .md + 10 .docx | -- | Documentation (Markdown + VCP-branded DOCX) |
| **Total** | **40** | **22,378** | **27 source + 13 test** |

### 25.2 Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Template-method pattern for workflows:** All 10 workflows inherit from `BaseRareDiseaseWorkflow`, ensuring consistent preprocess-execute-postprocess behavior.
2. **Workflow-specific collection weights:** Each workflow dynamically adjusts search weights across 14 collections, prioritizing domain-relevant evidence.
3. **Graceful degradation:** System operates in three modes: full (Milvus + LLM), search-only (Milvus only), and knowledge-only (no external dependencies).
4. **Pydantic-first data models:** All inputs, outputs, and internal data structures are Pydantic models with full validation.
5. **Cross-agent triggers:** Workflows automatically identify when other intelligence agents should be consulted.

### 25.3 Version Information

| Component | Version |
|---|---|
| Knowledge Base | 1.0.0 |
| API | v1 |
| Agent | 1.0.0 |
