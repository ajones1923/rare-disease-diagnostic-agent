## 4. Tab 2: Differential Diagnosis

### Purpose

View ranked disease candidates matched to the patient's phenotype profile.

### What to Highlight

- **Similarity scores:** Each candidate disease shows a 0-1 score reflecting phenotype match quality
- **Matched phenotypes:** HPO terms the patient shares with the disease
- **Unmatched phenotypes:** Disease features not observed in the patient (important for targeted evaluation)
- **Inheritance pattern:** Autosomal dominant, recessive, X-linked, etc.
- **Causal genes:** Known genes to guide confirmatory testing

### Expected Output (Marfan Scenario)

| Rank | Disease | Score | Matched HPO | Inheritance |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Marfan syndrome | 0.92 | HP:0001166, HP:0001519, HP:0004382, HP:0001083 | AD |
| 2 | Loeys-Dietz syndrome | 0.71 | HP:0001166, HP:0004382 | AD |
| 3 | Homocystinuria | 0.58 | HP:0001166, HP:0001519, HP:0001083 | AR |
| 4 | Ehlers-Danlos (vascular) | 0.45 | HP:0001166 | AD |

### Demo Steps

1. Navigate to **Variant Review** tab
2. Enter variant details:
   - Gene: FBN1
   - Variant type: missense
   - Population frequency: 0.00001
   - De novo: Yes (confirmed)
   - ClinVar: pathogenic
   - Computational prediction: damaging
3. Click **Classify Variant**

### Expected Output

```
Classification: PATHOGENIC
Criteria Met: PS1, PS2, PM2, PP3
Score: Path=11, Benign=0
Evidence Summary: "PS1: Same amino acid change as established pathogenic
  (score=4). PS2: De novo confirmed (score=4). PM2: Absent from controls,
  freq 0.00001 < 0.0001 (score=2). PP3: Computational evidence supports
  deleterious (score=1). Total pathogenic score: 11. Classification: pathogenic."
```

### Additional Variant Scenarios

**Benign variant (BA1):**
- Gene: Any
- Population frequency: 0.08 (8%)
- Result: BENIGN (BA1 standalone)

**VUS:**
- Gene: FBN1
- Variant type: missense
- Population frequency: 0.001
- Computational: "tolerated"
- Result: VUS (conflicting evidence)

## 9. ACMG Classification Demo

### Full ACMG Walkthrough

Demonstrate the variant classification pipeline with a classic pathogenic variant:

```json
{
  "gene": "SCN1A",
  "variant_type": "nonsense",
  "population_frequency": 0.0,
  "is_de_novo": true,
  "de_novo_confirmed": true,
  "computational_prediction": "damaging",
  "in_clinvar": true,
  "clinvar_classification": "pathogenic",
  "phenotype_specific": true
}
```

**Walk through each criterion:**
1. **PVS1 (+8):** Null variant (nonsense) in SCN1A, which is LOF-intolerant
2. **PS1 (+4):** ClinVar reports this variant as pathogenic
3. **PS2 (+4):** De novo, confirmed with parental testing
4. **PM2 (+2):** Absent from population databases (freq = 0)
5. **PP3 (+1):** Computational tools predict damaging
6. **PP4 (+1):** Phenotype (Dravet syndrome) is highly specific for SCN1A

**Total: 20 points -> PATHOGENIC**

## 12. Demo Tips

### Talking Points

1. **The diagnostic odyssey:** "Rare disease patients wait an average of 5-7 years for diagnosis. This agent compresses that timeline by integrating phenotype matching, variant classification, and therapy identification into a single platform."

2. **HPO-based matching:** "Each phenotype is weighted by its Information Content -- rare, specific findings like ectopia lentis carry more diagnostic weight than common ones like seizures."

3. **ACMG rigor:** "Variant classification follows the same ACMG/AMP framework used by clinical labs, with 23 of the 28 criteria systematically evaluated and scored."

4. **Gene therapy revolution:** "12 gene therapies are now approved for rare diseases. The agent matches patients to eligible therapies based on disease, genotype, and access pathway."

5. **Platform integration:** "The agent connects to the broader HCLS AI Factory -- cardiology, pharmacogenomics, and clinical trial agents can be consulted automatically."

### Common Questions

**Q: Is this for clinical use?**
A: This is a research and demonstration platform. Clinical use would require HIPAA compliance, regulatory validation, and integration with clinical workflows. The underlying algorithms (ACMG, HPO matching) follow published clinical standards.

**Q: How current is the knowledge base?**
A: The knowledge base version is 1.0.0 (March 2026). The RAG architecture allows incremental updates by adding records to vector collections without retraining.

**Q: Can it handle novel diseases?**
A: The phenotype-driven approach can identify candidate genes even for uncharacterized diseases by matching symptom patterns to known gene-phenotype associations. The "Undiagnosed Disease" workflow is specifically designed for these cases.
